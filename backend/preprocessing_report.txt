SURVEY DATA PREPROCESSING REPORT (CORRECTED)
==================================================

Original dataset: dropoffs.csv
Preprocessed dataset: dropoffs_preprocessed_20250715_214048.csv
Processing date: 2025-07-15 21:40:48

PREPROCESSING STEPS COMPLETED (CORRECTED PROCESS):
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. Irrelevant Column Removal (QR codes, emails, empty columns)
3. Consent Validation (removed non-consenting respondents)
4. Missing Value Analysis
5. Checkbox Response Separation
6. Data Type Standardization
7. SPARSE COLUMN REMOVAL (CRITICAL STEP - WAS MISSING!)
8. Duplicate Detection and Removal
9. Final Data Quality Check

DATASET STATISTICS:
Final rows: 78
Final columns: 86
Sparse columns removed: 26
Memory usage: 0.17 MB

CHECKBOX SEPARATION SUMMARY:
Total binary columns created: 69
Binary columns removed (sparse): 11
Binary columns retained: 58
- Which genres do you enjoy watching the most: 9/14 columns retained
- How do you usually discover movies you decide to watch: 6/7 columns retained
- Where do you usually watch movies: 4/8 columns retained
- Why do you usually choose to watch movies: 8/9 columns retained
- In general, what are the main reasons you stop watching movies before finishing: 6/6 columns retained
- Which genres do you find yourself stopping more often before finishing: 11/11 columns retained
- Why do you usually pause the movie: 8/8 columns retained
- Do you usually do other things while watching movies: 6/6 columns retained

SPARSE COLUMN REMOVAL DETAILS:
Threshold used: 90% sparsity
Columns removed: 26
Rationale: Columns with >90% missing/zero values provide minimal analytical value

DATA TYPES:
- int8: 58 columns
- string: 28 columns

CRITICAL CORRECTION MADE:
The original preprocessing was incomplete - it failed to remove sparse columns
after checkbox separation. This correction ensures only meaningful columns remain.
This is proper data preprocessing, not feature engineering.
