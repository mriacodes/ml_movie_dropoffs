METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

1. DATA SOURCE AND ACQUISITION
===============================

1.1 Data Collection Instrument
------------------------------
The study utilized a comprehensive survey instrument designed to capture movie-watching behavior patterns. The survey was distributed via Google Forms and contained 86 structured questions across multiple categories:

- Genre Preferences: Preferred and avoided movie genres
- Decision Factors: How movies are discovered and selected
- Multitasking Behavior: Activities performed while watching movies
- Technical Factors: Device usage, streaming quality issues

1.2 Data Acquisition Method

1.3 Data Sources Integration
---------------------------
Primary Dataset: Survey responses (dropoffs.csv)
- 78 respondents × 96 original features
- Mixed data types: categorical, ordinal, binary, and free-text responses

Secondary Dataset: IMDB Movie Database (imdb_data.csv)
- 5,000+ movies with metadata

2. DATA PREPROCESSING PIPELINE
===============================

2.1 Initial Data Cleaning
-------------------------
Phase 1: Data Quality Assessment
- Removed irrelevant columns (QR codes, email addresses, timestamp artifacts)
- Validated consent responses (excluded non-consenting participants)
- Identified and handled missing values (3.2% overall missing rate)

Phase 2: Sparse Column Removal
- Applied 90% sparsity threshold
- Removed 26 columns with minimal analytical value
- Retained 86 meaningful features for analysis

Phase 3: Checkbox Response Processing
- Separated multi-select checkbox responses into binary columns
- Created 69 binary indicator variables
- Applied logical validation for mutually exclusive responses

2.2 Data Type Standardization
----------------------------

- Binary variables: Consistent 0/1 encoding
- Numerical variables: Range validation and outlier detection

2.3 Target Variable Construction
-------------------------------
Primary Target: "Have you ever started watching a movie but did not finish it?"
Secondary Validation: "How often do you stop watching movies before finishing them?"

Encoding Strategy:
- Class 0 (Completer): "Never" or "Rarely" stop movies (35.90%)
- Class 1 (Dropper): "Sometimes" or "Often" stop movies (64.10%)

Target Distribution Analysis:

- Considered acceptable for model training without heavy balancing

3. FEATURE ENGINEERING EXPERIMENTS
===================================

3.1 Feature Construction Methodology
-----------------------------------
The feature engineering process was systematically designed to capture behavioral patterns predictive of movie dropoff tendency. Four primary categories of features were developed:

Category 1: Behavioral Aggregates
- total_stopping_reasons: Count of selected dropout reasons
- total_genres_stopped: Count of genres frequently abandoned
- total_multitasking_behaviors: Count of concurrent activities during viewing
- genre_completion_ratio: Ratio of enjoyed genres to stopped genres

Category 2: Engagement Scores
- patience_score: Composite measure of viewing persistence
- attention_span_score: Derived from pause frequency and multitasking
- social_influence_score: Impact of social factors on viewing decisions
- watch_frequency_score: Normalized viewing frequency metric

Category 3: Discretized Features
Applied multiple discretization strategies:
- Uniform binning: Equal-width intervals for continuous variables
- Quantile binning: Equal-frequency intervals for skewed distributions
- Domain-specific binning: Custom breakpoints based on behavioral theory

Category 4: Encoded Categorical Variables
