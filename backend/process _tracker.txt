1. Raw Data Preparation
    - Preprocessing - cleaning nulls, correcting types, standardizing formats
    - Seeding - filling in missing columns/data (e.g., movie titles, completion status, reasons)
2. Feature Construction
    - Feature Transformation - encoding, scaling, discretizing, one-hot encoding
    - Feature Engineering - creating new fields (e.g., engagement score, genre count)
3. Model Framing -  this is where you define what to predict and what inputs to use.
    - Defining Target - create your y
    - Feature Extraction - selecting which features become X
4. Assembling Final Dataset - This step combines target + features into a single DataFrame for modeling. You typically do this by: ml_dataset = final_df[feature_cols + [target_col]]

5. Data Balancing & Validation Prep -  SMOTE must be applied only on the training set, never the full dataset.
    - train_test_split(X, y)
    - apply SMOTE to X_train, y_train
6. Model Evaluation
    - Experimentation
        - Decision Trees Based Methods
        - Naive Bayes Classification
        - Neural Networks (Artificial Neural Networks)
        - Nearest Neighbor Classification (K-NN)
    - Compare
        Use: 
           - F1-score 
           - Precision/Recall (especially for minority class) 
           - ROC-AUC
    - Visualize using confusion matrix, ROC curve
