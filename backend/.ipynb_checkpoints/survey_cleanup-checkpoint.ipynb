    "# Survey Response Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook handles the **preprocessing phase** for survey responses from `dropoffs.csv`, which contains user behavior data about movie watching habits and dropout patterns. This is part of the data preparation pipeline as outlined in the process tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing Steps (Data Cleaning Only):\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration** - Load survey data and examine structure\n",
    "2. **Consent Validation** - Remove respondents who didn't consent to participation  \n",
    "3. **Missing Value Analysis** - Identify and handle missing values appropriately\n",
    "4. **Checkbox Response Separation** - Convert multi-select responses into binary features\n",
    "5. **Data Type Standardization** - Ensure consistent data types across columns\n",
    "6. **Duplicate Detection** - Check for and handle any duplicate responses\n",
    "7. **Final Data Quality Check** - Validate cleaned dataset before saving\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes:\n",
    "- **This notebook focuses ONLY on data preprocessing/cleaning**\n",
    "- **No feature transformation, discretization, or feature engineering** (those will be handled in the next phase)\n",
    "- **No target variable creation** (will be done during model framing phase)\n",
    "- **Output**: Clean, preprocessed survey data ready for transformation phase\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the process tracker, this falls under **Step 1: Raw Data Preparation** specifically for the survey responses dataset."
