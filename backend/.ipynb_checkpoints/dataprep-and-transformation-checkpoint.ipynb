    "1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration** - Load survey data and examine structure\n",
    "2. **Consent Validation** - Remove respondents who didn't consent to participation\n",
    "3. **Checkbox Response Separation** - Convert multi-select responses into binary features\n",
    "4. **Categorical Data Discretization** - Transform categorical responses into numerical codes\n",
    "5. **Feature Engineering** - Create aggregate features and engagement metrics\n",
    "6. **Data Quality Validation** - Check for missing values, outliers, and data consistency\n",
    "7. **Final Dataset Preparation** - Create ML-ready datasets for modeling\n",
